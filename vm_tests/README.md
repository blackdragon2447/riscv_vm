# VM_TESTS

This directory contains any tests to be run on the vm.
(as opposed to tests run on parts of the code).

The `official_tests/` folder contains a submodule with
the official riscv tests, we currently only use the isa
tests in there.

The `custom/` folder contains/will contain any custom tests
that have to be run on the vm.
